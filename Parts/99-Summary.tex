\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{both-cont}
 both are continuous (measured on the same subject):
 
 	\begin{enumerate}
	\item comparing the means of variables â€“ the same thing about the same subjets, examining mean change: \textbf{paired t-test}
	\item  examining relationships between variables: \textbf{correlation, regression}
	\end{enumerate}
\item\label{one-cont} one continuous dependent variable divided into independent groups according to another, categorical variable: (that is, comparing means of groups)

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item number of groups=2: \textbf{two-sample t-test} (Independent t-test)
	\item number of groups>2: \textbf{One-way ANOVA} (Analysis of Variance)
	\end{enumerate}
\item both are categorical: examination of contingency tables, \textbf{$\chi^2$ test}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In \ref{both-cont}. and \ref{one-cont}. we assumed that the samples come from normal distribution. If this assumption does not hold or we have ordered data, use \textbf{nonparametric methods based on ranks}.

\subsection{Effect of a new drug}
To test the effect of a new drug, the temperature was measured on the same 10 patients before and after the treatment. The mean of the differences is = 0.6, the standard deviation of the differences is SD=0.4062. Test whether the drug is effective or not; i.e., test whether the change in mean is different from 0 at $\alpha$=0.05 level.

\subsection{Drug side effect}
Two medicines are being compared regarding a particular side effect; 100 similar patients are split randomly into two groups, one of each group. In the group of drug A, 10 side effects were observed while in the group of drug B only 2 side effects were observed. Test whether drug and side effects are independent!\bigskip
